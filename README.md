## Task 1: Random Distributions and Correlations

- Created a 4x4 random array from an exponential distribution.
- Visualized histograms of exponential, uniform, and normal distributions.
- Plotted a 3D surface plot of the function \( Z = X^2 + Y^2 \).
- Calculated Pearson and Spearman correlations for selected features from a dataset.
- Visualized correlations using heatmaps.

## Task 2: Au Nano Particle Dataset Analysis

- Loaded and filtered the dataset for features: `N_total`, `N_bulk`, `N_surface`, and `R_avg`.
- Displayed the first 20 samples.
- Calculated mean, standard deviation, and quartiles for these features.
- Plotted histograms of features in a 1x4 layout.
- Visualized feature relationships with seabornâ€™s `pairplot`.
- Customized pair plots using `PairGrid` to show histograms, kernel density estimations (KDE), and bivariate KDE plots.
